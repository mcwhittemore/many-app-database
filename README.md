# Many App Database

This is a toy module for using one database to story many apps data in.

It also tracks user interaction with your apps via the `getUser` function.

The goal of this module is to make writing toy apps that need a back end very easy to write.

I'm not going to show an example yet. I'm not sure you should use this.
